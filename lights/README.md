Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just about any x86 system with DOS and a mouse.

Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the classic puzzle game where you try to get all of the lights out.
Each light you click will swap its state (on or off) as well as the four
surrounding lights (if existant).  The levels are randomly generated and you
get only a certain amount of time to complete each level.  If you exceed this
time, the level will restart.  After completing a level, the amount of time
left is added to the score.  The game is over only after you run out of moves
(you have 5000 to complete as many levels as you can get through).  After the
size of the matrix gets to 10x10, it remains 10x10 but game play continues.

Game Play
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the mouse for clicking on the lights and selecting menu items.
